# BAE-Todo-List

Tech Project 

This task will evaluate your technical ability regarding web technologies as well as your ability to learn new techniques.

Your task is to create a personal Todo web application using node and typescript. It should allow you to add tasks, toggle them complete and remove them.

You need to:
Create an api allowing users to add, toggle complete and remove tasks from the task list,
Create a basic frontend that allows users to interact with the api. It doesn’t have to be styled
nicely and you can use any web technologies you want be it react or native javascript /
Typescript.

Additional features
Persistent storage – tasks should be saved somehow between restarts.
Dockerisation – Dockerise the application, docker is a tool that allows developers to
standardise the environment that their code runs in. I don’t think that you covered docker in
School of code but its not as complicated as it sounds. Look on the Docker website for their
documentation and have a look at the docker init command for a basic quickstart.

Application testing – Applications should always be tested on an ongoing basis, write a few
test cases covering the api to ensure that it meets your expectations.
CI/CD – A ci pipeline is an automatic job that runs when you perform an action on a
repository eg pushing, merging etc. Make a Github action that runs all your tests when you
push to a branch or merge to main. Again, I don’t think you have done this in the school of
code but theres plenty of resources out there to have a go.

Basic CSS – style the frontend. It doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just make it more
presentable.
Multiple task lists – allow for more than one task list.
Out of scope
The following features will be considered out of scope for this task:
Authentication and authorisation – Do not write a login system for this application, it will
only be for one user and the tasks are not considered sensitive.
